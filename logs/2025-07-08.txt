🗓️ Developer Log – July 8, 2025
✅ What I Did:
🔧 Integrated GET route from backend into frontend using fetch() and Tailwind UI

🧠 Debugged CORS issues and fixed them using cors middleware in Express

💥 Resolved DOM-related JavaScript error (null target due to missing id)

🎨 Cleaned up UI layout: converted grid → vertical stack using flex-col

🧪 Successfully fetched and displayed medicines from MongoDB on frontend

💾 Pushed full frontend + backend updates to GitHub
🔗 medicine-reminder-app

⚠️ What Went Wrong:
Typo in id="medicine-container" caused JS crash

Script ran before DOM loaded → fixed with defer and DOMContentLoaded

🧠 What I Learned:
CORS middleware is required when fetching across localhost ports

JS document.getElementById() fails silently if the ID doesn’t exist

Tailwind flex-col items-center can create clean vertical card layouts

Debugging is not frustrating when you're building with intent

📌 Next Action Plan:
⏭ Add a form on frontend to POST new medicine reminders

⏭ Connect to /api/medicines/add

⏭ Optional: auto-refresh card list after submission

⏭ Push new updates to GitHub + commit message
